To connect the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi to the K30 CO₂ sensor, I used a UART (serial) communication setup. The K30’s TX pin was connected to the Arduino’s RX pin (12), and the K30’s RX pin to the Arduino’s TX pin (13), the K30 ground connected to the Arduino ground, and the K30 VCC connected to the Arduino 5V (when using a Arduino uno R3 or some other boards you may need an external power supply). Using the Arduino’s hardware serial interface, I wrote a simple sketch to request CO₂ concentration data from the sensor and display the live readings on the Serial Monitor. This allowed real-time monitoring of CO₂ levels directly through the Arduino IDE, ensuring reliable data exchange between the sensor and microcontroller.![Screenshot 2025-10-17 2.33.43 PM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mjc1OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--93da27057e57f6241bef4271edb813e0b71158d8/Screenshot%202025-10-17%202.33.43%20PM.png)
