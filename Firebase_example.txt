Firebase storage:

Arduino pushes readings as { value: 450, timestamp: 1726700000000 } under /co2/history in Firebase.

This keeps a small history (last 50 readings) for the chart.

Live chart:

Uses Chart.js to display CO₂ over time.

Updates automatically whenever new data is pushed to Firebase.

Embedding in Google Sites:

Go to Insert → Embed → Embed Code, paste this snippet, and it will show your live CO₂ monitor with a chart.
