üå± Solar-Powered CO‚ÇÇ Monitor (Arduino Uno R4 WiFi + K30 Sensor)

This project is a solar-powered CO‚ÇÇ monitoring system built using an Arduino Uno R4 WiFi and a K30 10,000 ppm CO‚ÇÇ sensor.
It continuously measures CO‚ÇÇ concentration in the air and publishes live readings to a local HTML webpage over Wi-Fi ‚Äî enabling real-time wireless monitoring. Additionally, readings with timestamps are sent to Firebase Realtime Database for cloud-based logging, remote access, and long-term data analysis.

üß™ Research & Development

The project began with extensive research to identify the best CO‚ÇÇ sensor and microcontroller for reliable, long-term monitoring. After evaluating several options, I chose the K30 sensor for its high accuracy and 10,000 ppm range, as well as its UART communication capability. I initially experimented with the ESP8266 for its built-in Wi-Fi, but its limited memory and I/O flexibility made it less suitable for handling both the sensor and cloud integration. This led me to switch to the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi, which offered a more stable, flexible platform with sufficient resources and built-in wireless connectivity.

I also explored the Arduino Cloud IoT system and the Web Editor to manage devices and push data online. While it worked for basic testing, I found it restrictive for full customization and long-term, cost-free deployment. This led me to adopt Firebase Realtime Database, which allows real-time, globally accessible data storage without additional cost. This choice also simplified integrating live web visualizations and remote access.

Throughout the development process, I learned to configure UART communication, work with Arduino‚Äôs Wi-Fi libraries, and use HTTPS requests to send JSON-formatted readings to Firebase. I experimented with local HTML visualizations using Chart.js before embedding a dynamic, live-updating webpage into Google Sites for easy public access. Each decision‚Äîsensor selection, board choice, cloud platform, and web integration‚Äîwas informed by research and hands-on testing.

This iterative research and experimentation ensured a robust, scalable CO‚ÇÇ monitoring system that provides real-time visualization, cloud logging, and remote access, while keeping costs low and leveraging free platforms whenever possible. The resulting setup combines hardware reliability with flexible software tools for both immediate monitoring and long-term data analysis.

üíª Software Overview

Written in Arduino C++

Uses Serial1 for UART communication with the K30

Uses WiFi and WiFiClientSecure libraries for network connection and Firebase HTTPS requests

Uses Chart.js on the Arduino-hosted webpage for live graph visualization

Sends CO‚ÇÇ readings with timestamps to Firebase Realtime Database for cloud storage and long-term analysis

Example Data Output (Serial Monitor)
CO2 Reading: 412 ppm
Sending data to Firebase...
Firebase response: {"name":"-NAbC12345abc"} 

üåê Webpage Visualization

Access the Arduino‚Äôs IP address from a device on the same Wi-Fi network.

The webpage displays a live graph of the CO‚ÇÇ readings, updating every 2 seconds.

Chart.js is used for smooth, dynamic plotting.

Local graph shows recent readings (~last 20), while Firebase stores all historical data.

‚òÅÔ∏è Firebase Logging

Each reading is stored as a JSON object:

{
  "timestamp": 12345678,
  "co2": 450
}


Firebase automatically generates unique keys for each reading.

Cloud logging enables remote monitoring, historical analysis, and potential integration with dashboards or analytics tools.

üîß How It Works

Arduino reads CO‚ÇÇ ppm from the K30 sensor via UART.

Data is displayed on a live, local webpage for immediate visualization.

Simultaneously, readings with timestamps are sent to Firebase Realtime Database via HTTPS POST requests.

This combination of local visualization and cloud logging allows real-time monitoring, historical tracking, and remote access ‚Äî improving upon the limitations of a local-only webpage.

üìà Improvements Over Local Webpage Only

Historical data is stored in the cloud for analysis.

Remote access is possible from anywhere with internet.

Provides both instant visualization and persistent logging for a complete CO‚ÇÇ monitoring solution.
